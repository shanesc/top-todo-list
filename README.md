# Todo List

This is a simple todo list using vanilla Javascript, SOLID principles and the concepts of modular code organization. The assignment is from The Odin Project, and details can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list).

An event aggregator was used to allow more loosely-coupled communication between the various modules (separating the data logic and the handling of the DOM).
